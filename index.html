 <li> HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard markup language for creating web pages. It defines the structure and content of web pages, using a system of tags and elements that browsers interpret to display content like text, images, and links. </li>
 <li>JavaScript is a versatile, high-level, interpreted programming language primarily used to create interactive effects within web browsers. It is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS.</li>
 <li>CSS is among the core languages of the open web and is standardized across Web browsers according to W3C specifications. Previously, the development of various parts of CSS specification was done synchronously, which allowed the versioning of the latest recommendations. You might have heard about CSS1, CSS2.1, or even CSS3. There will never be a CSS3 or a CSS4; rather, everything is now just "CSS" with individual CSS modules having version numbers.</li>
<li>GitHub is a proprietary developer platform that allows developers to create, store, manage, and share their code. It uses Git to provide distributed version control and GitHub itself provides access control, bug tracking, software feature requests, task management, continuous integration, and wikis for every project.</li>
